Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. Modern AI systems use machine learning algorithms and natural language processing to analyze vast amounts of data. These sophisticated systems do more than find exact matches—they understand context, meaning, and structure. However, the rapid advancement of AI also raises ethical concerns regarding data privacy and the potential for academic misconduct in educational settings.
